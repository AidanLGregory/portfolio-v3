My name is Aidan and I am a freelance developer with a background in computer networking / security. I have been working in this field for 7 years now and this has been a long term passion of mine. Developing is a much newer thing for me. I began my development journey in 2018 with teaching myself the basics of web development. Since then, I have continued to learn and branched off from pure web development into web &#38; software development.</p>
